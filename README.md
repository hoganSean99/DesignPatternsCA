# DesignPatternsCA
I am creating a Library system while implementing Software Design Patterns \
The Design Patterns I am Implementing are as follows

- Strategy Pattern
- Decorator Pattern
- Factory Pattern
- Observer Pattern
- Command Patter
- Template Pattern

Along with implementing the above patterns, I also wanted to get the patterns to work with each other \
The following are the patterns I got working together

- Command Pattern with the Observer Pattern

I also learned about the different types of principles

- **S**ingle Responsability
- **O**pen-Close Principle
- **L**iskov Substitution 
- **I**nterface segregation principle
- **D**ependency inversion principle
